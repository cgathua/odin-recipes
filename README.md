# odin-recipes
 This is my first Odin Project, after completing Freecode Camp responsive web design course. The purpose of the exercise per Odin Project, is to test the use of HTML, lists, links, images, file structure and the use of Git/Github.
 This project is responsive on Mobile/Desktop and is also a three page basic website, that utilizes Grid, Flex-box, CSS Variables & Semantic HTML.
